# Aspiration_demo
ReactJS - coding exercise - Xebia/Aspiration


This project is more open ended and you're free to make use of whatever Open Source frameworks, libraries, and patterns you find would be useful. The project is attached to this email, it's an empty repo (again you're free to structure it however you like) with all the instructions in the README file, but I'll give a quick introduction in this email.

 

Your task is to build a React web application that displays all the "topics"(https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/objects#topic) related to the term "react", using the GitHub GraphQL API. The application should display how many "stargazers"(https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/objects#stargazerconnection) each topic has. A click on a topic should display the topics related to that topic, and how many stargazers they have. And so forth.


Again full instructions are in the readme file, but feel free to reach out to me by email if anything is unclear or blocking you from moving forward. When you've completed please send me the finished zip file with updates to the readme file where it's stated.  


Please consider the following points as well when writing the code for the assignment:-

 I am making sure, the client does not reject because of the below parameters

Try to create reusable components.
Separation of concern is important, have a separate data layer. 
Try to keep the components as close to pure as possible. Meaning no fetching the data inside the react components.
If you can use styled-components and add the theme as well that would add a lot to weightage.
Remove dead code, unused variables.
No console warnings of any kind.
